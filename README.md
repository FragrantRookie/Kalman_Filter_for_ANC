# Kalman Filter Approach for Active Noise Control

Another renowned approach for adaptive active noise reduction is the modified FxLMS algorithm, depicted in Figure 0. The internal model technique utilizes the secondary path estimate to recover the disturbance from the error signal, enabling the use of the traditional least mean square (LMS) algorithm for noise control. This altered configuration can also be employed to implement the Kalman filter methodology, wherein the LMS model is substituted with the Kalman filter to complete the updating of the control filter.

In order to employ the Kalman filter methodology, the initial step entails establishing the state function. The subsequent paragraphs will elucidate the state function definition of the ANC system. As we know, when the adaptive algorithm converges, the ANC system should achieve the optimal control filter, which is a constant solution:
$$\begin{equation}\mathbf{w}(n+1)=\mathbf{w}(n)=\mathbf{w}\_{\text{o}},\end{equation}$$
 where $\mathbf{w}_{\text{o}}$ denotes the optimal control filter. Meanwhile, the attenuated noise can be expressed as 
 $$\begin{equation}e\_\mathrm{o}(n)=d(n)-\sum^{L-1}\_{i=0}\hat{s}\_l\cdot\mathbf{x}^\mathrm{T}(n-i)\mathbf{w}\_\mathrm{o}(n-i),\end{equation}$$
 where $d(n)$ and $\mathbf{x}^\prime(n)$ represent the disturbance signal and the reference vector, respectively, and $\hat{s}$ stands for the $i$-th coefficient of the secondary path estimate. Since the optimal control filter is a constant vector, (2) can be rewritten to
 $$\begin{equation}d(n)=\mathbf{x}^\prime(n)^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{w}\_\mathrm{o}(n)+e\_\mathrm{o}(n),\end{equation}$$
 and the filtered reference signal is given by 
 $$\begin{equation}\mathbf{x}^\prime(n)=\sum^{L-1}\_{i=0}\hat{s}_i\mathbf{x}(n-i).\end{equation}$$
# Code Explanation

The section provides a concise introduction to the `KF.mat` file, which implements the Kalman filter method for a single-channel active noise control (ANC) application. Furthermore, the FxLMS algorithm is conducted as a comparative analysis. The Kalman filter technique employs the modified feed-forward active noise control (ANC) structure, whereas the FxLMS algorithm uses the conventional feed-forward ANC structure.

## Cleaning the memory and workspace

This segment of code is utilized to clean the memory and workspace of the MATLAB software. 

```matlab
close all ;
clear     ;
clc       ;
```

## Loading the primary and secondary path

This part of the code loads the primary path and secondary path from the Mat files: `PriPath_3200.mat` and `SecPath_200_6000.mat`. All these paths are synthesized from the band-pass filters, whose impulse responses are illustrated in Figure 1.

```matlab
load('PriPath_3200.mat');
load('SecPath_200_6000.mat') ;
figure ;
subplot(2,1,1)
plot(PriPath);
title('Primary Path');
grid on      ;
subplot(2,1,2);
plot(SecPath);
title('Secondary Path');
xlabel('Taps');
grid on      ;
```

## Simulation system configuration

The sampling rate of the active noise control (ANC) system is set to $16000$ Hz, and the simulation duration is $0.25$ second. To simulate the dynamic noise, the primary noise in this ANC system is a chirp signal, whose frequency gradually varies from $20$ Hz to $1600$ Hz, as shown in Figure 2.

```matlab
fs = 16000     ; % sampling rate 16 kHz.
T  = 0.25      ; % Simulation duration (seconds).
t  = 0:1/fs:T  ;% Time variable.
N  = length(t) ;
fw = 500       ;
fe = 300       ;
y = chirp(t,20,T,1600);
figure   ;
plot(t,y);

## Creating the disturbance and filtered reference

The disturbance and filtered reference used in the ANC system are created by passing the chirp signal through the loaded primary and secondary paths.

```matlab
%X  = 0.4*sin(2*pi*fw*t)+0.3*sin(2*pi*fe*t);
X = y;
%plot(X(end-100:end))
D  = filter(PriPath,1,X);
Rf = filter(SecPath,1,X);
%plot(D(end-100:end))
```

## Dynamic noise cancellation by the single channel FxLMS algorithm

In this part, the single-channel FxLMS algorithm is used to reduce the chirp disturbance. The length of the control filter in the FxLMS algorithm has $80$ taps, and the step size is set to $0.0005$. Figure 3 shows the error signal picked up by the error sensor in the ANC system. This figure shows that the FxLMS algorithm can not fully attenuate this dynamic noise during the $0.25$ second. 

```matlab
L   = 80    ;
muW = 0.0005;
noiseController = dsp.FilteredXLMSFilter('Length',L,'StepSize',muW, ...
    'SecondaryPathCoefficients',SecPath);
[y,e] = noiseController(X,D);

xlabel('Time (seconds)')   ;

```

## Dynamic noise cancellation by the Kalman filter approach

The Kalman filter is employed in the signal-channel ANC system to track the fluctuation of the chirp disturbance. The variance of the observed noise is initially set to $0.005$. Figure 4 shows the error signal of the Kalman filter algorithm. Additionally, Figure 5 illustrates the variation of the coefficients $w_5(n)$ and $w_{60}(n)$ as time progresses. The outcome illustrates that the Kalman filter effectively mitigates the chirp disturbances. The Kalman filter approach has markedly superior convergence behavior compared to the FxLMS method, as illustrated in Figure 6. 

```matlab
q  = 0.005;
P  = eye(L);
W  = zeros(L,1);
Xd = zeros(L,1);
ek = zeros(N,1);
w5 = zeros(N,1);
w60 = zeros(N,1);

%-----------Kalman Filer---------

    Xd     =[Rf(ii);Xd(1:end-1)];
    yt     = Xd'*W ;
    ek(ii) = D(ii)-yt ;
    K      = P*Xd/(Xd'*P*Xd + q);
    W      = W +K*ek(ii)        ;
    P      =(eye(L)-K*Xd')*P    ;
